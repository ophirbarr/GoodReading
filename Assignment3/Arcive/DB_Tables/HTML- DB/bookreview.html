<td class='normal' valign='top'>Leshem creates a powerful story of an Israeli soldier&#39;s life at Beaufort in Southern Lebanon in 98- 00. Its an intense story, following a young commander in the army as he tries to keep his troops sane and alive while fighting for Israel&#39;s retention of land in the southern part of its northern neighbor. What emerges is this juxtaposition of a seriously unsettled political and military matter with the life of many young &quot;kids&quot; (as leshem refers to the soldiers). Its hard to imagine that this is how life is for these soliders, but as we know this is how life is. Many of the soldiers in the story are &quot;wasted&quot; and you see how the soldiers learn to cope or at best learn to try.   This book received a lot of praise when it first was published in Israel in 2006 (under the title &quot;If Heavens Exist&quot;) and was popularized when read by many soldiers who were fighting in the 2nd israeli-hezbollah conflict. Somewhat of a foreshadowing of the dangers of hezbollah gaining strength and returning an attack, this book must have hit home for the soldiers who read it in 2006 and their families; especially those who lost a son or daughter in battle.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>I&#39;m a huge fan of military non-fiction. Caputo, Herr, and Sajer have always been at the top of my favorite authors list, but Lesham gets a major thumbs up. I think Beaufort is fiction (as opposed to non-fiction) but you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell from reading it since Lesham does such a fantastic job of breathing life into the main character, who weaves his way through the chaos of a war and winds up on the other side thanks to luck more than anything else. This isn&#39;t a book about heroes and charging machine gun nests. It&#39;s about one guy and his friends, his troops, who just want to make it out, and I absolutely loved it.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>This was a pretty great book and I loved all the suspense, but I still think that it&#39;s pretty harsh for one of Harry&#39;s last protectors, and certainly the most powerful, to just... die. It&#39;s pretty sad but I would definitely continue reading the series and I would recommend these books for anyone who likes a good read. Overall, this is a pretty amazing book and if I were you, I would definitely download this.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>When I was young, I was an avid book reader. I loved all kinds of books. In high school, I lost interest in reading. The Harry Potter books were so good that I started reading again! It was so entertaining that I would be working and reading at the same time. It was that good. Harry Potter was an ordinary boy who finds out he&#39;s actually a wizard. A famous one, at that. He was a baby when he somehow defeated the antagonist, Lord Voldemort. Lord Voldermort had disappeared since Harry defeated him as a baby. But Lord Voldemort had resurfaced in recent years and was looking for trouble. Harry, in his 5th year at school, is learning about Lord Voldemort&#39;s past. Harry needs to learn Lord Voldemort&#39;s secrets to defeat him once and for all. With the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, Harry navigates through the school year of a typical wizarding high school and the dangers of finding Lord Voldemort&#39;s secrets.    It&#39;s a good book! A definite must read. I would recommend all of Harry Potter books to all ages.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>I got hooked on these books by accident around when the second movie came out. After that, I had to read them all and I was one of those people who would buy the book at the midnight release.  The same happened with my mother so I started buying them for her on in large print so she could easily read them without straining her eyes.  The story is simple without being too over-the-top fantasy (my opinion) like other series I could never really get into.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>I read this book when it first came out several years ago. It was my first Dan Brown title, and I have since read many others, including all of tge books in this series. I love the pace, suspense, and intricate weaving of details from both art and history into the book. The story keeps you guessing until the very end and does not disappoint when it finally does close. It is so well done that even when finished it left me with questions and a desire to further read about the historical &amp; Biblical references from the book. If you have ever studied art history or the history of the church and love suspense novels, this book may be for you. Fun, full of suspense, and hard to put down. It kept me happy 12 years ago while on bed rest during a hot July while pregnant (not an easy task!) and I enjoyed it again when I listened to it on Audible it last year. One of my favorite modern fiction titles!</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>I actually really enjoyed this story and thought the overall conspiracy was somewhat plausible. The author did a great job of describing places that I could form a visual image in my head and it also made me look up some places and pieces of art so that I could see what was going on.    The characters are likeable and the intensity of the race to the Holy Grail is very suspenseful and kept me engaged in the book and ultimate conclusion. The bad guys have the problem I don’t like in most books which is always being one step ahead of the good guys but in this book it was explained and made perfect sense.    The narrator did a good job and I didn’t really have any issues with their narrations, voices or accents.    My only issue with the book was the “out of nowhere” romantic storyline that was thrown in at the end of the book. Off-topic note: The character of Robert Langdon is like the preppy version of Indiana Jones that I have to question the casting of Tom Hanks in the role now.</td>
